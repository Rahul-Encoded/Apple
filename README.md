# SussySolver - AI Blackboard Math Solver (No Cap) ‚úçÔ∏èüß†

Okay, so peep this project. It's basically a digital blackboard where you can doodle math problems like you're in class, but then instead of getting stuck, you yeet it to an AI, and it, like, *solves* it for you. Trying to make finding the hypotenuse slightly less... tragic? Def.

## What's the Tea ‚òï (Features)

*   **Doodle Away:** Got a math problem? Just draw it right there on the canvas. Fr.
*   **Pick a Vibe:** Choose your drawing color. Because aesthetic matters, even in math. ‚ú®
*   **Oops, Eraser:** Messed up? No cap, just switch to erase mode.
*   **Send It:** Hit 'Calculate' to send your masterpiece (or mathasterpiece?) to the backend.
*   **AI Glow-Up:** Get the answer back, looking all clean and proper (thanks, Math Renderer!).
*   **Variable Memory:** The app actually keeps track of variables you've assigned (`x=5`? It remembers!). This gets sent to the AI so it uses the right values. Big brain moves. üòé
*   **Smooth UI:** Clean and simple interface, easy to navigate. No extra clutter.

## The Stack (Current Vibes)

Here's what's making this project run rn:

### Frontend (That UI Energy)

*   **React:** The main framework vibe.
*   **TypeScript:** Keeping types in check so stuff doesn't break randomly. Type safety is key üîê.
*   **Axios:** For hitting up the backend API easily.
*   **Framer Motion:** Adding those smooth animations for the draggable math output. ‚ú®
*   **KaTeX:** THE real MVP for making math notation look fly. Way less drama than other options. üìà
*   **@mantine/core:** Snagged the `ColorSwatch` and `Group` components 'cause they looked clean.
*   **dotenv (for VITE\_API\_URL):** Keeping that API URL secret and sound. üëÄ

### Backend (The Brains)

*   **Python:** The language where the magic happens.
*   **FastAPI:** Super fast framework for the API. Fast AF boi. üèéÔ∏è
*   **Uvicorn:** Making the server run.
*   **python-dotenv:** Loading environment variables. Gotta keep those API keys safe. ü§´
*   **google-generativeai:** Connecting to the actual AI model (Gemini!). Where the math gets solved. ‚ú®
*   **PIL (Pillow):** Handling the image data from the canvas.
*   **ast, json:** Parsing the AI's response (carefully!).

## How to Get It Running (Less Cringe Than Setting Up a Printer)

1.  **Clone the Repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-directory>
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    *   Navigate into the `backend` folder: `cd backend`
    *   Install Python dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install requirements.txt
        ```
        *(You might already have some, but this ensures you get the ones used)*
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder. Get your Google AI Studio API key and add these lines:
        ```env
        GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
        SERVER_URL=127.0.0.1 # Or your local IP/host
        PORT=8000 # Or whatever port you want
        ENV=dev # Use 'dev' for auto-reloading
        ```
    *   Make sure you have the `ai_notes_prompt.txt` file in the correct location (`backend/ai_notes_prompt.txt`).
    *   Run the backend server:
        ```bash
        uvicorn main:app --reload
        ```
        *(Or if you're running `main.py` directly: `python main.py`)*

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    *   Navigate into the frontend folder (assuming it's at the root or `frontend`): `cd ../frontend` (if you're in `backend`) or `cd .` (if you're at the root).
    *   Install Node.js dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        # or
        yarn install
        ```
        *(This includes React, KaTeX, Framer Motion, Axios, etc.)*
    *   Create a `.env` file in the frontend project root. Point it to your backend:
        ```env
        VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 # Use the host and port from your backend .env
        ```
    *   Start the frontend dev server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        # or
        yarn dev
        ```

4.  **Go Time!** Open your browser to the frontend URL (usually `http://localhost:5173` or similar). Draw, calculate, vibe.

## The Plot Twist üé≠ (Libraries We Ghosted)

Okay, real talk, development isn't always smooth sailing. We initially tried integrating some libs that seemed perfect but ended up being a bit... extra?

*   **MathJax:** Wanted that sweet math rendering. The docs for v2 felt kinda ancient, and trying to get it to play nice with newer React versions (v18+) was a whole thing. Fighting versioning issues and their slightly complex API for dynamic content update? Not the vibe.
*   **react-draggable:** Seemed like the move for making the output draggable. But, classic tale, ran into the infamous `TypeError: findDOMNode is not a function` error. This happens when older versions of `react-draggable` (or other libs using `findDOMNode`) clash with newer React versions. It's a sign the library isn't fully updated for modern React hooks/rendering.

**Lesson Learned:** Sometimes the newer, simpler, or purpose-built library (like **KaTeX** for math rendering - it's fast and has a straightforward API) or just using a robust one that *is* updated (like **Framer Motion**, once we fixed the ref issue) is the way to go. Don't get caught up fighting deprecated APIs if you don't have to! üíÖ

## AI's Secret Sauce ü§´ (The Prompt)

Okay, so the AI (Gemini) is doing the heavy lifting for solving, but it doesn't just *magically* spit out the answer in the right format. That's where the **Prompt** comes in.

Think of the prompt as giving the AI super specific instructions, like a cheat sheet for how to understand the image, what math rules to follow (PEMDAS!), what cases to handle, and **CRUCIALLY** what format the output should be in.

Initially, the AI was just sending back plain text or wrapping the output in markdown code blocks (` ```json `). That messed up the backend's parsing (`ast.literal_eval` was NOT happy). By carefully tweaking the prompt ‚Äì adding instructions to use LaTeX syntax for math expressions and to **ONLY** output the raw Python list of dictionaries with no extra characters ‚Äì we got the AI to behave and send data that the backend could actually work with.

This whole experience really shows how wild and powerful **prompt engineering** is in AI apps. It's like writing code, but for the AI's brain! The prompt is kinda the secret ingredient that makes the AI's output usable for our specific needs.

Yeah, the actual `ai_notes_prompt.txt` file? That's low-key the secret sauce, so it's not in this public repo. üòâ But understanding its importance is key to how this whole thing vibes. Mind blown ü§Ø.
