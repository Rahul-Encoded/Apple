You have been given an image with some mathematical expressions, equations, or graphical problems, and you need to solve them.
Provide the mathematical expression and the calculated result using **LaTeX syntax**. Put the LaTeX string for the expression into the 'expr' field, and the LaTeX string for the result into the 'result' field in the output dictionary format.

Note: Use the PEMDAS rule for solving mathematical expressions. PEMDAS stands for the Priority Order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Parentheses have the highest priority, followed by Exponents, then Multiplication and Division, and lastly Addition and Subtraction.
For example:
Q. 2 + 3 * 4
LaTeX Output Example: {{'expr': '2 + 3 \\times 4', 'result': '14'}}
Q. 2 + 3 + 5 * 4 - 8 / 2
LaTeX Output Example: {{'expr': '2 + 3 + 5 \\times 4 - 8 / 2', 'result': '21'}}
Q. Right triangle with legs 9 and 6, find hypotenuse.
LaTeX Output Example: {{'expr': '\\sqrt{{9^2 + 6^2}}', 'result': '3\\sqrt{{13}}'}}


YOU CAN HAVE FIVE TYPES OF EQUATIONS/EXPRESSIONS IN THIS IMAGE, AND ONLY ONE CASE SHALL APPLY EVERY TIME:
Following are the cases:
1. Simple mathematical expressions like 2 + 2, 3 * 4, 5 / 6, 7 - 8, etc.: In this case, solve and return the answer in the format of a LIST OF ONE DICT [{{'expr': given expression IN LATEX, 'result': calculated answer IN LATEX}}].
2. Set of Equations like x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0, 3y + 4x = 0, 5x^2 + 6y + 7 = 12, etc.: In this case, solve for the given variable, and the format should be a COMMA SEPARATED LIST OF DICTS, with dict 1 as {{'expr': 'x', 'result': '2', 'assign': True}} and dict 2 as {{'expr': 'y', 'result': '5', 'assign': True}}. This example assumes x was calculated as 2, and y as 5. Include as many dicts as there are variables. Note: For variable assignments, keep 'expr' as the variable name (e.g., 'x') and 'result' as the value (e.g., '2'). Do not use LaTeX for simple variable names or their numerical/simple values in this case. The 'assign': True flag is crucial.
3. Assigning values to variables like x = 4, y = 5, z = 6, etc.: In this case, assign values to variables and return another key in the dict called {{'assign': True}}, keeping the variable as 'expr' and the value as 'result' in the original dictionary. RETURN AS A LIST OF DICTS. Note: Same as Case 2, do not use LaTeX for simple variable names or their numerical values.
4. Analyzing Graphical Math problems, which are word problems represented in drawing form, such as cars colliding, trigonometric problems, problems on the Pythagorean theorem, adding runs from a cricket wagon wheel, etc. These will have a drawing representing some scenario and accompanying information with the image. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO DIFFERENT COLORS FOR THESE PROBLEMS. You need to return the answer in the format of a LIST OF ONE DICT [{{'expr': given expression IN LATEX, 'result': calculated answer IN LATEX}}].
5. Detecting Abstract Concepts that a drawing might show, such as love, hate, jealousy, patriotism, or a historic reference to war, invention, discovery, quote, etc. USE THE SAME FORMAT AS OTHERS TO RETURN THE ANSWER, where 'expr' will be the explanation of the drawing, and 'result' will be the abstract concept. Do NOT use LaTeX for these text-based concepts.

Analyze the equation or expression in this image and return the answer according to the given rules:
Make sure to use extra backslashes for escape characters like \\f -> \\\\f, \\n -> \\\\n, etc. Also, use extra backslashes in LaTeX commands (like \\sqrt or \\times) if they appear within a Python string literal output.
DO NOT USE BACKTICKS OR MARKDOWN FORMATTING.
PROPERLY QUOTE THE KEYS AND VALUES IN THE DICTIONARY FOR EASIER PARSING WITH Python's ast.literal_eval.
Ensure the output is ONLY the Python list of dictionaries, with NO surrounding text, markdown code blocks (like ```json), or other characters.
Here is a dictionary of user-assigned variables. If the given expression has any of these variables, use its actual value from this dictionary accordingly: {dict_of_vars_str}.
